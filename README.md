# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This repo is for a boot camp exersize showing a understanding of semantic HTML elements, proper CSS styling, and image labeling, with focus on accessibility. I have added the MIT Licence to the readme as to ask for feedback on the work.


## Installation

You can run this code in VS Code, or any other coding application of your preference. 

## Usage
This is just an exercize module for a bootcamp course. While it has little practical usage, it servers as an example of my work as a beginner and my continued growth.
